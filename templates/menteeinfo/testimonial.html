                        "My mentor gave me advice about applying to universities abroad for a PhD drawn from his own experiences. We had numerous meetings to discuss topics such as PhD in India vs PhD abroad, how the two might be different, what I should be aiming for in a PhD (finding a good advisor), what constitutes a good advisor vs a toxic advisor, etc. All of this was very helpful to me." I could just ping my mentor on Google chat anytime and he'd fix a date and time for a meeting. This was flexible enough to account for blockers on our ends. He was very approachable in the time we had our discussions, and the discussions were fruitful."

                            "He was very supportive and talked to me in detail about my interests and my preparation level. He told me some reference books to go through and also helped me in writing cover letters and getting some idea of company-specific interviews. We didn't follow any particular plan as such during the mentorship, I asked him whatever I had a doubt in, as and when needed. He was easy to approach, and I'm grateful he took time out of his busy schedule to guide and help me with my placements!"

                            "The placement mentorship program is a good way to keep a check on oneself, whether you are doing preparation upto the mark or not. It is really beneficial for people who have lesser connections with seniors in terms of the career path they are aiming for. Personally, I got a pretty good mentor, and I always kept having a chat with him amidst my placements. Of course the hard work is your own part, but it's a good method to get an update of our preparation. From getting my resumes reviewed to seeking help regarding DSA and strategies in relation to company tests, my mentor assisted me with most of the things."

                            "My mentor Archana, was MTech from the same branch Electrical Engineering, ICS discipline. She is placed in Google for DFT profile. I had very fruitful discussions with her. Especially regarding the topics that are important for placement and the priority of topics to prepare. I had periodic interaction with her. Most of the discussion was around the priority of topics and the sources for preparation. I was very comfortable interacting with Archana since she was from my batch (TA) (2021). Especially with the priority of topics, I knew how to go about the preparation and in what depth."
